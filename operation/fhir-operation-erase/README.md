|`ID`|required|The Resource ID|

**Method** - GET or POST

|Parameter Name|Type|Value|

**HTTP Response Codes**

- 200 OK - The resource is permamently deleted.
- 400 BAD_REQUEST - The request is malformed.
- 401 NOT_AUTHENTICATED - The users is not authenticated.
- 403 NOT_AUTHORIZED - The user is not an administrator in the FHIR_ADMIN group.

**Examples**

### POST

```
curl --location --request POST 'https://test.fhirexample.com/fhir-server/api/v4/Patient/1785fb0759b-1452d2e5-f568-442e-9841-3dc3940af5bc/$erase' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/fhir+json' \
--header 'Authorization: Basic ...' \
--data-raw '{
  "resourceType": "Parameters",
  "parameter": [
    {
      "name": "patient",
      "valueString": "patient-id-is-this-id"
    },
    {
      "name": "reason",
      "valueString": "My Reason for removing this resource"
    }
  ]
}'
```

#### Response - All Done

Response Code: 200
Response Body: Return Operation Outcome telling the person that it is confirmed to be deleted.

```
{
    "resourceType": "OperationOutcome",
    "issue": [
        {
            "severity": "information",
            "code": "informational",
            "details": {
                "text": "Resource 'Patient/1785fb0759b-1452d2e5-f568-442e-9841-3dc3940af5bc' and corresponding versions are erased"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

#### Response - Almost All Done

Response Code: 200 
Response Body: Return Operation Outcome telling the person that we almost hit a limit while deleting. (TRANSACTION TIMEOUT - > Commit, Rollback, Lock)
- May need mitigation, and extend the timeout and manual cleanup

```
{
    "resourceType": "OperationOutcome",
    "issue": [
        {
            "severity": "warning",
            "code": "warning",
            "details": {
                "text": "Resource 'Patient/1785fb0759b-1452d2e5-f568-442e-9841-3dc3940af5bc' deleted up to version '4', more remain"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

Note, we do not support GET.

**Server Invariants**

1. For Resources where the latest resource is deleted, Search is not possible.
2. For Resources updated inflight, the operation may fail due to locking, and the client is expected to retry.
3. Operations `$history` use custom change tables which do not include Patient data.

**Implementation Considerations**

1. Resources which are created incorrectly, should be $erased, rather than updated. For instance, a resource incorrectly identified with MRN1 which should be MRN2.
2. Erase remove all versions of a Resource to maintain the integrity of the datastore.
3. The Audit Record that is generated includes a patient specific id and reason for the deleted record that is added to the Audit Record.
4. While not preferred, the UUID may be reused, however any dangling references may reference the new resource improperly.

**Out-of-Scope**

The following are out-of-scope: 
1. Version specific deletes, however, constructing certain Bundle types results in non-deterministic results. This was deemed to be too error prone.
2. No Version specific reindexing.
3. Included Resources are not deleted and are implementor choice to remove - for instance, a patient with a provenance, only the patient is deleted.
4. The downstream caches are not erased - e.g. Private Http Caches.

**Business Logic Considerations**

The following should be considered:
1. If you are looking up the Patient ID via MRN using Search, then Patient resource should be deleted last.
