# Using the ibmcom/db2 docker image

Running fhir server integration tests using docker db2.


## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com)
- `ibmcom/ibm-fhir-server:latest` (built with the fhir-install module)


## Run

From the root of the project (aka the "WORKSPACE"):
1. Set up and start the containers
    ```sh
    build/pre-integration-test-docker.sh
    ```
2. Run the tests
    ```sh
    mvn test -DskipTests=false -f fhir-server-test
    ```
3. Collect logs and tear down the containers
    ```sh
    build/post-integration-test-docker.sh
    ```

## Details

The `pre-integration-test-docker.sh` script will
1. collect fhir-server-config-db2.json and the fhir-operation test jar; to be mounted from the fhir-server docker-compose service
2. build the db2 image, bring it up, create the db, deploy the schema, and allocate a tenant; this updates the fhir-server-config in the process
3. bring up fhir-server and exit when its ready
