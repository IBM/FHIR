[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/IBM/FHIR.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/IBM/FHIR)

## IBM FHIR Server
The IBM FHIR Server is a modular Java implementation of version 4 of the [HL7 FHIR specification](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/r4/http.html) with a focus on performance and configurability.

For a detailed description of FHIR conformance, please see https://github.com/ibm/fhir/blob/master/docs/Conformance.md.

The server can be packaged as a set of jar files, a web application archive (war), an application installer, or a Docker image.

### Running the IBM FHIR Server
The IBM FHIR Server is currently under development. To run the server you must clone or download the project and build it. See https://github.com/IBM/FHIR/wiki/Setting-up-for-development for more info.

Information on installing and running the IBM FHIR Server will be available in the User Guide at https://github.com/ibm/fhir/blob/master/docs/FHIRServerUsersGuide.md, but presently this document needs love/attention.

### Building on top of the IBM FHIR Server
IBM FHIR Server artifacts will become available on JCenter and Maven Central with a group ID of `com.ibm.fhir` in the near future.

For example, if you are using Maven and would like to use our object model (including our high-performance parser, generator, and validator), you could declare the dependency like this:
 
```
...
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.ibm.fhir</groupId>
      <artifactId>fhir-model</artifactId>
      <version>${fhir.version}</version>
    </dependency>
    ...
```
