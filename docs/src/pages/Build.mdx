<PageDescription>
This article outlines the build process from a local machine and from the build server (Travis, GitHub actions). 
</PageDescription>

There are two 

# Build: GitHub actions

# Build: Travis 
The build with [Travis](https://travis-ci.com/IBM/FHIR) is triggered through a `push` or `pull_request` or `cron` event.  The `push` is the only event which is enabled in the **IBM FHIR Server** build. 


# Build: Local 

## Build and Deploy

### examples 
- set the version with rc=NUMBER where the NUMBER is version of the release. 

``` shell 
mvn clean -Drc=1 -Pdeploy-version-rc -f fhir-examples/pom.xml -N
```
 
- build and deploy 

``` shell
mvn clean install javadoc:jar javadoc:test-jar -Pdeploy-bintray,fhir-javadocs deploy -f fhir-examples/pom.xml  
```

### tools
- set the version 

``` shell 
mvn clean -Drc=1 -Pdeploy-version-rc -f fhir-tools/pom.xml -N
```
 
- build and deploy 

``` shell
mvn clean install javadoc:jar javadoc:test-jar -Pdeploy-bintray,fhir-javadocs deploy -f fhir-tools/pom.xml  
```

### parent 
- set the version 

``` shell 
mvn clean -Drc=1 -Pdeploy-version-rc -f fhir-parent/pom.xml -N
```
 
- build and deploy 

``` shell
mvn clean install javadoc:jar javadoc:test-jar -Pdeploy-bintray,fhir-javadocs deploy -f fhir-parent/pom.xml  
```

* Locally * The local connection to bintray takes around 30-40 minutes to build, test and deploy.  

# Tips
If the build appears to randomly stop complaining about a 400 error, the issue might be one of the following: 

## 1 Naming of the artifactId might include a space. 
The artifactId might have a space in it. 

```<artifactId>fhir-notification-websocket </artifactId>```

 convert to 
 
 ```<artifactId>fhir-notification-websocket</artifactId>```

## 2 The BinTray Key might need to be checked. 
If you are able to successfully upload, there may be a need to check BinTray via commandline. 

```
