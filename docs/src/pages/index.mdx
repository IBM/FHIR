## Conformance
The IBM FHIR Server conforms to version 4.0.1 (R4) of the HL7 FHIR specification.

We use [AEGIS Touchstone](https://touchstone.aegis.net/touchstone/analytics/published?month=201909&spec=FHIR%204.0.0&pa=HL7_FHIR_SERVER&testSystem=5d5e96a10a120e7f08942098&supportedOnly=true&cb=/HL7_FHIR_4_0_0)
to publish our conformance results on a monthly basis.

For a detailed description of conformance, please see [Conformance](/Conformance).

## Running the IBM FHIR Server
Information on installing, configuring, and running the IBM FHIR Server is available in the User Guide at [FHIRServerUsersGuide](/guides/FHIRServerUsersGuide).

The IBM FHIR Server is currently under development. To run and develop with the server, you must clone or download the project and build it.
See [Setting up for development](https://github.com/IBM/FHIR/wiki/Setting-up-for-development) for more info.

## Building on top of the IBM FHIR Server
IBM FHIR Server artifacts are available in BinTray with a group ID of `com.ibm.fhir`.

For example, if you are using Maven and would like use our object model (including our high-performance parser, generator, and validator),
you could declare the dependency like this:

``` xml
...
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.ibm.fhir</groupId>
      <artifactId>fhir-model</artifactId>
      <version>${fhir.version}</version>
    </dependency>
    ...
</dependencies>
```
