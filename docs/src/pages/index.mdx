## Running the IBM FHIR Server
Information on installing and running the IBM FHIR Server is available in the User Guide at [FHIRServerUsersGuide](/guides/FHIRServerUsersGuide).

The IBM FHIR Server is actively developed. To run and develop with the server, you must clone or download the project and build it. 
See [Setting up for development](https://github.com/IBM/FHIR/wiki/Setting-up-for-development) for more info.

## Building on top of the IBM FHIR Server
IBM FHIR Server artifacts are available in BinTray with a group ID of `com.ibm.fhir`.

For example, if you are using Maven and use our object model (including our high-performance parser, generator, and validator), you could declare the dependency like this:

``` xml
...
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.ibm.fhir</groupId>
      <artifactId>fhir-model</artifactId>
      <version>${fhir.version}</version>
    </dependency>
    ...
</dependencies>
```
